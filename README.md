# launchpad

I worked for LaunchPad Trampoline Park from September 2016 to September 2020. At the beginning of 2018, I noticed that our method of employee scheduling was inefficient and problematic at times. Each week, a picture of the schedule was uploaded to the employeeâ€™s Facebook group. There were many occasions where two employees tried to change shifts, but due to miscommunication, neither employee came to work.

I thought it would be really cool to have an app where employees could switch shifts and have the schedule update in real-time. At this point, this was far-fetched idea, as I had no mobile development experience and had no clue where I would begin.

After experimenting with multiple programs and frameworks, I came across Flutter, a cross-platform mobile development framework, using the Dart programming language. The framework also utilized tools like Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Xcode. I also used Firebase as a backend data storage system.

I worked on the app for most of the summer of 2018, and finally published it to the Google Play Store on November 27, 2018. I later published the app on the Apple App Store in early 2019 (though it is only available through TestFlight).

Please explore the my code in the lib folder!
